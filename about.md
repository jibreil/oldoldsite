# About me

Hi, my name is Jibreil and I'm a high school student from Sydney, NSW. In my experience so far, I have focused on web development, creating a few websites for both personal use and professional clients. As such, most of my programming skills focus on web development but I'm always eager to learn new skills and languages. I also have knowledge and skills in computer hardware, from troubleshooting hardware and software to building custom rigs.
